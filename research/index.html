<h1>Research</h1>
<p>My overarching research vision is to better understand <b>embodied intelligence</b> by creating new physical forms and analyzing how current digital forms are created. I pursue this vision through two branches: robot design and networked cultures. These two approaches combine to form a unified approach for more ethical embodiment both on and off-screen. </p>

<!-- When finish thesis tree, copy what Philip Guo does re: thesis tree
* One slide on thesis tree
* Short slides on thesis tree going into more depth

Also eventually break up this space into picture + more in-depth like for the projects page

<h2>Robotics Research</h2>

<p>In robotics, my focus is primarily on <b>computational material robots</b> -- robots with advanced functionality through the algorithmic design of their material properties. Robotics is traditionally the combination of three fields: mechanical engineering, computer science and electrical engineering. Recently, there has been more of a push to add a fourth field to the mix, material science, creating new <a href="http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/robotics/2/12/eaar4527.full.pdf">material robots</a> that use the embedded intelligence within their material properties to create new techniques. My goal is to create customizable computational material robotics so that given a task, robots can be autonomously designed, optimized and fabricated for any application. This has led me to create novel soft robotic manipulators and modular volumetric actuators, as well as explored the needed sensors and computation to allow for these robots to interact with their environment and be produced efficiently.</p>

<h3>Computational Design</h3>

<p>I am currently working on building on <a href="http://robertmaccurdy.com/docs/2016_MacCurdy-Printable%20Programmable%20Viscoelastic%20Materials%20for%20Robots.pdf">this prior work</a> about programmable viscoelastic materials for further applications.</p>

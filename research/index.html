<h3>Handed-Shearing Auxetics</h3>

Explain what shearing auxetics are like


<h4>Paper: <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/632">Handedness in shearing auxetics creates rigid and compliant structures</a></h4>

<p>Published in Science, DOI: 10.1126/science.aar4586 </p>

<b>Abstract:</b> In nature, repeated base units produce handed structures that selectively bond to make rigid or compliant materials. Auxetic tilings are scale-independent frameworks made from repeated unit cells that expand under tension. We discovered how to produce handedness in auxetic unit cells that shear as they expand by changing the symmetries and alignments of auxetic tilings. Using the symmetry and alignment rules that we developed, we made handed shearing auxetics that tile planes, cylinders, and spheres. By compositing the handed shearing auxetics in a manner inspired by keratin and collagen, we produce both compliant structures that expand while twisting and deployable structures that can rigidly lock. This work opens up new possibilities in designing chemical frameworks, medical devices like stents, robotic systems, and deployable engineering structures.

<h4>Paper: <a href="http://lillych.in/files/Chin-2018-robosoft_HSA_hands.pdf">Compliant Electric Actuators Based on Handed Shearing Auxetics</a></h4>

<p>Published in 2018 IEEE-RAS International Conference on Soft Robotics (RoboSoft), 2018. </p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper, we explore a new class of electric motor-driven compliant actuators based on handed shearing auxetic cylinders. This technique combines the benefits of compliant bodies from soft robotic actuators with the simplicity of direct coupling to electric motors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique by creating linear actuators, a four degree-of-freedom robotic platform, and a soft robotic gripper. We compare the soft robotic gripper against a state of the art pneumatic soft gripper, finding similar grasping performance in a significantly smaller and more energy-efficient package.</p>

<h3>Computational Design</h3>

Explain something like this

<h5>temp</h5>

The lazy way to do this is to just have abstracts of each project and put it all up in a list

ACtually still basically just that - have a bit more intro for overview
- links to video and actual paper

- for topics that don't have things, just have basic summary of what is going on (see Rachel)


For projects, it's ok if I don't have too much explanation (especially for projects I basically forgot what happened)
- Just put down what remember and have lots of pictures (see what McCabe did - also see what Marcel did for 2.72 for heavy explanation)

	<p>I did FIRST Robotics for several years, starting off in FIRST Lego League in middle school (2007 - 2009) and then FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in high school (2010 - 2013). </p>

	<p>FRC is by far what inspired me to pursue engineering as strongly as I do now. Our FRC team qualified for internationals every year and helped me understand the best practices behind CAD, wiring, and software.</p>

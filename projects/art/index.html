<h4>Glassblowing</h4>
<p>I was very fortunate to get selected for the beginner's glassblowing class in Fall 2016 at MIT. This class is heavily oversubscribed and lottery dependent, so I had been trying for the past 4 years trying to get into the class. I spent 8 weeks learning how to blow glass, working up from paperweights to cups to pulled-neck vases.</p>

<h4>Woodworking</h4>
<p>Since I lived in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/">Random Hall</a> and <a href="http://www.eastcamp.us/">East Campus</a>, both East Side dorms with a culture of building, I was used to building little improvements to my room - whether a shelf or a loft. Although those "pieces" are mostly just from scrap wood from whatever fort or rollercoaster East Campus decided to make this year, I have a few nice woodworking pieces with actual finished wood.</p>

<h5><br>2.75 - Kinematic Coupled Tea Set</h5>
<p>Although the main thrust of 2.75 is the <!-- TODO: link medical device here -->medical device that you work on for the entire year, there are side projects as part of the class. We were tasked to make any project that involved a <a href="http://kinematiccouplings.org/">kinematic coupling</a>, a way to exactly constrain (instead of overconstrain) two components, thus ensuring precision layout. I decided to make a kinematically coupled tea set so that my tea-loving boyfriend could host tea parties more easily. My report can be found <a href="/files/Chin_KC_Writeup.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm overall very pleased with how my project came out. I used the <a href="http://studentlife.mit.edu/hobbyshop">Hobby Shop</a> for the first time, an extremely nice and friendly machine shop on campus, and learned how to use wood stain and sealant. I used a band saw + jig to cut out the main circles, a CNC router for the inset circles, a router + jig for the V-grooves and the Random Hall laser cutter to etch the characters. </p>

<h4>Blacksmithing</h4>
<p>I got to take the Introduction to Blacksmithing class over IAP 2016 where I got to learn basic techniques such as how to make tapers, scrolls, and twists and how to build up more complex pieces from there. I ended up making a snail doorstop which involved forge welding two pieces of metal together into one shape. I also went to Open Forge infrequently through 2016 and 2017, where I tried to make bottle openers, forks and spoons.</p>

<h4>Metal Projects</h4>
<h5>2.670 - Flashlight</h5>
<p>2.670 is the introduction to machining class for mechanical engineers. I took it in IAP 2015. There, we followed the Edgerton Shop training which is to build a flashlight using a mill and lathe. I had never used a lathe before, so this was a good class to take before taking <a href="/projects/hardware/lathe.html">2.72</a>.</p>

Note the knurl." img2 = "2670flashlight002.jpg" title2 = "Completed flashlight" caption2 = "It is just a bulb threaded straight into the main rectangle. The battery is in the handle, so the connection is controlled by twisting the flashlight head."%}

<h5><br>2.008 - Paperweight</h5>
<p>As part of 2.008, in addition to the main <a href="/projects/hardware/yoyo.html">yoyo manufacturing project</a>, there was the paperweight project. We had to make a yoyo of our own design that would use both a CNC lathe and mill. I chose to make a paperweight that had the logo of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros.">Super Smash Bros. game series </a>. From this project, I learned how to use MasterCam to plot out the machining paths as well as write up a process plan.</p>

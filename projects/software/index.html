<h3>My main Github link is <a href="https://github.com/ltchin">here</a></h3>

<p>Most of my programming experience has been in conjunction with hardware, so please check out my <a href="/projects/hardware">hardware projects page</a> as well</p>

<p>If you are still interested in looking at Githubs, there is my very old one <a href="https://github.com/hm29168">here</a> and the account used for my <a href="/projects/hardware/FIRSTRobotics.html">FIRST Robotics</a> team <a href="https://github.com/wiredcats">here</a>.</p>

<!-- TODO: Flesh this out / link to the same pages as the hardware section-->

<h3>Writing </h3>
<p>The following are some pieces that I am particularly proud of. Some are papers from classes that I have taken at MIT, while others are just personal writing</p>

<h4>litchin@ and mellifluously@</h4>
<p>Since 2014, I have had a literary mailing list (litchin@) and a musical mailing list (mellifluously@) which I would send various musings to. An archive of posts made (albeit missing the lively community of responses) can be found <a href="http://litchin.wordpress.com">here</a>.</p>

<h4>CMS.300 - Introduction to Video Game Theory - Fall 2015</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/mikael-jakobsson/">Professor Mikael Jakobsson</a>. I really enjoyed this class and managed to write papers that I didn't feel were overly rushed by my college life. I also really appreciated the opportunity to dig deeply into game studies, which was something I never felt like I got a formal grounding in before taking this class.</p>

<h4>CMS.845 - Interactive Narrative - Spring 2016</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://www.nickm.com/classes/interactive_narrative/2016_spring/">Professor Nick Montfort</a>. It's been the first time in a while since I've done a creative writing class since elementary school and I found the work really cool.</p>

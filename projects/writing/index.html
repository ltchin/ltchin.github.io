<h3>Writing </h3>
<p>The following are some pieces that I am particularly proud of. Some are papers from classes that I have taken at MIT, while others are just personal writing</p>

<h4>litchin@ and mellifluously@</h4>
<p>Since 2014, I have had a literary mailing list (litchin@) and a musical mailing list (mellifluously@) which I would send various musings to. An archive of posts made (albeit missing the lively community of responses) can be found <a href="http://litchin.wordpress.com">here</a>.</p>

<h4>CMS.300 - Introduction to Video Game Theory - Fall 2015</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/mikael-jakobsson/">Professor Mikael Jakobsson</a>. I really enjoyed this class and managed to write papers that I didn't feel were overly rushed by my college life. I also really appreciated the opportunity to dig deeply into game studies, which was something I never had a formal grounding in before taking this class.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/files/ltchin_EpicSaxGame.pdf">Analysis</a> of <a href="http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/epicsaxgame/EpicSaxGame.html"><i>Epic Sax Game</i></a></li>
	<li><a href="/files/ltchin_PapersPlease.pdf">Analysis</a> of <i>Papers, Please</i></li>
	<li><a href="/files/ltchin_Pikmin2.pdf">Analysis</a> of <i>Pikmin 2</i>. Also <a href="/files/ltchin_Pikmin2_Notes.pdf">research notes</a><!-- and in-progress arguments (many of which were ultimately cut due to space constraints)-->.</li>
</ul>

<h4>CMS.845 - Interactive Narrative - Spring 2016</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://www.nickm.com/classes/interactive_narrative/2016_spring/">Professor Nick Montfort</a>. It's been the first time in a while since I've done a creative writing class since elementary school and I found the work really cool.</p>
<h5><i>Ex Machina</i> by Jonathan Ball</p></h5>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="ExMachina.html">Twine version</a> of the main book</li>

<h4>CMS.616 - Games and Culture - Fall 2016</h4>
<p>I took this class with <a href="http://tltaylor.com/">Professor TL Taylor</a>. It's honestly been an honor to work with her and I've really enjoyed looking more in-depth in sociological issues around gaming. Although the papers were a bit more surface level than I would have liked, I definitely feel like I have the groundwork for doing more research</p>
 <ul>
 	<li><a href="https://litchin.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/cms-616-multiplayer-tetris/">Midterm paper</a> studying the dynamics of different Tetris communities. </li>
 	<li><a href="/files/ltchin_CMS616Final.pdf">Final paper</a> about the co-creative relationship between speedrunners and developers. </li>
 </ul>

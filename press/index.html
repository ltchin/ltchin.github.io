<h4>Jeopardy</h4>
I won the <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/tournaments/2017/college-championship">2017 Jeopardy College Championship</a>, which led me to getting a lot of media attention, especially for my memetic Final Jeopardy response. Since Jeopardy is a national show, below is only a selection of the articles written about me, chosen for notability or a different perspective. 
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/spiciest-memelord-lilly-chin-jeopardy-podcast/">Podcast interview</a> from MIT's Comparative Media Studies department about how studying CMS helped me make sense of being other people's media object</li>

Video of me presenting these slides for Twitch is archived <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0IEF1OTFRM">here</a></li>

<h4>Jeopardy</h4>
<p>I won the <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/tournaments/2017/college-championship">2017 Jeopardy College Championship</a>, which led me to getting a lot of media attention, especially for my memetic Final Jeopardy response. I was then invited to compete on the <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/tournaments/2017/tournament-of-champions">2017 Jeopardy Tournament of Champions</a>, where I got to the semifinals. </p>

<p>My stats on Jeopardy can be found on <a href="http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=11142">J-Archive</a>. My old (not very impressive) NAQT trivia stats can be found <a href="https://www.naqt.com/stats/player/index.jsp?contact_id=92383">here.</a> </p>

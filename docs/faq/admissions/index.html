<h2 id="who-am-i-hiring">Who Am I Hiring?</h2>
<p>As of Sept. 2024, I am primarily hiring the following groups of people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current UT undergraduates
<ul>
<li>I do not take first semester undergraduates who come straight from high school</li>
<li>I <em>do</em> take transfer students and non-traditional undergraduates who are in their first semester</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Current UT graduate students</li>
<li>Prospective PhD students</li>
<li>Prospective postdocs with their own sources of funding</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to limited bandwidth, I currently cannot take on the following groups of people in my lab:</p>
<ul>
<li>High school students
<ul>
<li>Please check out programs specifically designed for high schoolers, such as <a href="https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute">RSI</a>, <a href="https://mites.mit.edu">MITES</a>, and <a href="https://fri.cns.utexas.edu/community-outreach/summer-high-school-research-academy">HSRA</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-UT undergraduates
<ul>
<li>Please check out other <a href="https://www.cientificolatino.com/reu">undergraduate research programs</a>, such as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/">NSF REU</a>, the <a href="https://www.nibib.nih.gov/training-careers/training-opportunities/besip">NIH BESIP</a>, <a href="https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/CoRIS/reu-robots-real-world">Oregon State&rsquo;s REU</a>, and <a href="https://riss.ri.cmu.edu">CMU&rsquo;s RISS</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- * **High school students**: As a new professor, I cannot provide the support needed for a positive high school research experience. 
* **First semester undergraduates, coming straight from high school**: No matter how much technical experience you have coming from high school, it will not prepare you for the level of independence you get in college. I would like first year undergraduates to have at least a semester of college life to explore a wider range of activities before committing to working with me for 10 hours / week. This auto-No does not apply to transfer students or non-traditional undergraduate students who are not coming directly from high school. 
I am currently oversubscribed with interest from UT undergraduates. 
* **Prospective Masters Students**: As a new professor, I need to build up my lab for the long term. I currently do not have the funds to support someone who will only be available for one to two years. -->
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to Apply</h2>
<p>If you are a current UT student or prospective postdoc, please email me directly using the advice <a href="/faq/emails#how-to-convey-your-interest-in-my-lab">HERE</a></p>
<p>If you are a prospective PhD student, please apply directly to UT Austin before sending me an email. You have two options for applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply to the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/academics/graduate/admissions">ECE department</a>, selecting DICE or bioECE as your academic track</li>
<li>Apply to the <a href="https://www.me.utexas.edu/academics/graduate-program/graduate-admissions">ME department</a>, selecting DSC as your academic track</li>
</ul>
<p>Please apply to the program whose curriculum most resonates with you. It does not matter what your major was in undergrad. Please also make sure to put my name down as a professor who you are interested in working with. If the application fee presents a financial hardship, I am happy to discuss with you first about your chances of getting in.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-review-grad-school-applications">How I Review Grad School Applications</h2>
<p>I read applications in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Statement of Purpose (SOP)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do we have meshing research interests?</li>
<li>What skills do they hope to gain in grad school?</li>
<li>What kinds of research experiences are they looking for? Will they only be satisfied by one specific kind of project or are they open to many types of project?</li>
<li>Do they have the experience I need for the projects I have?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recommendation Letters</strong>
<ul>
<li>Letters that just rehash &ldquo;X was a good student. You can see because they got a good grade in my class&rdquo; are a missed opportunity</li>
<li>Are there any stand-out personal anecdotes?</li>
<li>(stretch) Do they give a sense of what it&rsquo;s like to mentor this person?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>======= For most applications, I stop reading here =======</li>
<li><strong>CV</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does their experience match up with what they claimed in the SOP?</li>
<li>Are there interesting pieces of background that might prove useful to a project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transcript</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do they actually have the technical capabilities that they claimed in the SOP?</li>
<li>I do not care what your home department is. I am more interested in what classes you&rsquo;ve taken or work you&rsquo;ve done.</li>
<li>Poor grades in key classes are causes for concern. Showing improvement over the years will help</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(tied) GRE, TOEFL</strong>
<ul>
<li>So long as these are not dramatically lower than average, these have no weight on the application for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After reviewing all applications that specifically put me down as an advisor of interest, I quickly skim through other applications in my academic track to see if there are any other applicants that may be good fits. I compile a short list of applicants and then conduct hour-long interviews with those candidates.</p>
<p>In those interviews, I ask the following questions as a starting point for futher conversation. Half of the time is spent discussing research, while the other half is spent on discussing mentorship.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your experience is on all levels of the robot stack (mechanical, electrical, and computational)?</li>
<li>What skills are you hoping to gain from grad school?</li>
<li>Walk me through a hard technical problem you&rsquo;ve faced</li>
<li>What are you currently planning to do after you graduate with a PhD?</li>
<li>What are you looking for out of an advisor and lab community?</li>
</ol>
<p>From those interviews, I make a holistic judgement of <a href="/faq/admissions#what-i-am-looking-for-in-a-lab-member">advisor-advisee fit</a> and make offers depending on funding limitations.</p>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ultimately, what I&rsquo;m looking for is who you are a person. I&rsquo;m here to nurture your interests and if I can&rsquo;t get a sense of what those are or whether they match, then we are at an impasse.</li>
<li>When writing your SOP, be mindful of your audience. Are you writing to just one professor in your application? If so, then what if they don&rsquo;t have space? How do you think other professors who read your application will feel? Are you really committed to just that one professor or are you open to broader things?</li>
<li>Personal anecdotes matter a lot to me in the recommendation letters.
<ul>
<li>If the letter just rehashes what is in the CV, it&rsquo;s a missed opportunity. It verifies that you&rsquo;re telling the truth, but I would rather know what the letter writer took away from their relationship with you</li>
<li>Getting a letter from someone who you have done independent work with is really important, whether in a capstone project class, an internship or a research opportunity. This is the best chance of them actually knowing who you are as a researcher. If they can&rsquo;t talk about what you were like in the lab, then I have nothing to review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The CV tells me what you&rsquo;ve focused on in the past, but the SOP tells me what you&rsquo;re looking towards in the future. Do not rehash what you have done in the CV except to bolster this forward looking vision.</li>
<li>Seeing how you write in your SOP matters more than your TOEFL score. I will appreciate it if you include other samples of English writing, including non-technical writing.
<ul>
<li>Note that I <em>can</em> tell when ChatGPT is used because it is not a good writer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-am-looking-for-in-a-lab-member">What I Am Looking for in a Lab Member</h2>
<p>As a professor, my goal is to pursue my research interests by recruiting trainees whose research interests align with mine. I provide trainees with advising support (funding, space, advice, networking) so that they can accomplish their research goals. For a longer write-up, I recommend reading Section II and III of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Y8OuI2T-yxz__TyKxwvPsMHDOvis4R5qD7xk-An5xY/pub">MERGe Lab Expectations</a> document.</p>
<p>This means that the most important thing I look for in a student is <strong>fit</strong>. &ldquo;Fit&rdquo; is a very broad term; it encompasses the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research fit &ndash; are we interested in the same topics? do we ask complementary questions?</li>
<li>Technical fit &ndash; do we have the sufficient expertise to pursue those topics?</li>
<li>Funding fit &ndash; is there enough money available to pursue these questions?</li>
<li>Personality fit &ndash; can we get along with one another?</li>
<li>Communication fit &ndash; can we learn and teach in complementary ways?</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of &ldquo;fit&rdquo; goes both ways. I may not be the best advisor for you, even if we share very similar research interests. Similarly, you may not be the best student for me if we are unable to communicate. The admissions process is about both of us trying to figure out who the other person is and whether or not we&rsquo;d like to work with each other for many years.</p>
<p>As difficult as it may be to believe, <strong>a bad advisor-advisee fit is worse than not getting into grad school at all.</strong> We will both not be happy if you are doing something that you do not like for poor pay over 5-6 years. We will be <em>especially</em> miserable if we find that our personalities clash too much.</p>

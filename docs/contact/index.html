That doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t email them, but rather that you need to be strategic about how you email them to get a response. Here are my tips on how to get a response <em>from me</em>. These tips are probably useful for other professors as well, but you should ask them first!<nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#note-on-chatgpt>Note on ChatGPT</a></li><li><a href=#cold-email---general-tips>Cold Email - General Tips</a><ul><li><a href=#prospective-student>Prospective Student</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#communication-boundaries>Communication Boundaries</a></li></ul></nav><center><hr width=90%></center><blockquote><h2 id=note-on-chatgpt>Note on ChatGPT</h2><p>I discourage using ChatGPT to email me because</p><ol><li>I can usually tell</li><li>the writing style is hella annoying purple prose (link)</li><li>it robs you of a chance to develop your own writing skills</li></ol><p>If you must use it, please ask for it to give you a <em>very concise</em> email and don&rsquo;t just paste in the four paragraphs it spat out to you.

Bold is your friend if you want to highlight something for me to notice (so don&rsquo;t use it for every sentence!)</li></ul><h3 id=prospective-student>Prospective Student</h3><ul><li><p>Email very explicitly saying which project or research ideas on <a href=https://merge-lab.github.io/research/>the MERGe Lab website</a> is a good fit</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s ok if it&rsquo;s not a well-formed idea, but if I don&rsquo;t see any attempt to explain how you are related to my existing project, you are unlikely to get a response back</li><li><strong>A bad advisor-advisee fit is worse than not getting into grad school at all.</strong> We will both not be happy if you are doing something that you do not like for poor pay over 5-6 years.</li></ul></li><li><p>Think of talking with an academic like making music in a jam session (link).

I still don&rsquo;t know anything about exoplanets, but now there&rsquo;s something we can talk about. I&rsquo;m super curious to know what connections you see between my work and your interest in exoplanets</li><li>Better: &ldquo;I really liked your paper on X. I&rsquo;d like to explore more topics on X, especially to apply them to exoplanets.&rdquo; &ndash; Awesome! We can have a fun research conversation where I teach you about X and you can teach me about exoplanets!</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=communication-boundaries>Communication Boundaries</h2><p>If you know me personally, e-mail is the slowest way to get in contact with me. Please call, text or DM me on social media instead.</p><p>If you are not my student, colleague or do not know what my pet&rsquo;s species / name is, then you do not know me personally. Please do not use non-email channels to contact me until we have been introduced. Due to my <a href=https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11674>experiences with harassment</a>, I will <em>block you without hesitation</em> for violating these boundaries.</p><nav class=footer><hr><p class=text-muted style=float:left;text-align:left><small>Last updated: Feb 21, 2024<br><a href=/about title="About this site">About this site</a></small></p><p style=float:right;text-align:right><small><a href=/bio>About Me</a><br><a href=https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/>Contact Me</a></small></p></nav></body></html>

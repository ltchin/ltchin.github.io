      <description>Cross-Stitching I started cross-stitch in Dec. 2019, because of this Shitpost Sampler goose pattern sent to me by a friend. I was so taken by it that I taught myself from online resources in order to learn how to make it. This started a near addiction in me, especially as I found myself with a lot of time and screen burnout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Since most of my traditional hobbies became off limits, cross-stitching quickly became my go-to.</description>

      <description>This page is under construction. For now, enjoy my notes from the previous iteration of the website for what to include. All of these are from undergrad, so I may not include any of these moving forwards. I might just have them as an image gallery setup or a CV of failures.

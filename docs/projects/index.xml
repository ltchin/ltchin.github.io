&lt;p>I started cross-stitch in Dec. 2019, because of this &lt;a href="https://gumroad.com/l/EBtyT">Shitpost Sampler goose pattern&lt;/a> sent to me by a friend. I was so taken by it that I taught myself from online resources in order to learn how to make it. This started a near addiction in me, especially as I found myself with a lot of time and screen burnout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Since most of my traditional hobbies became off limits, cross-stitching quickly became my go-to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making</title><link>/projects/making/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/making/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This page is under construction. For now, enjoy my notes from the previous iteration of the website for what to include. All of these are from undergrad, so I may not include any of these moving forwards. I might just have them as an image gallery setup or a CV of failures.&lt;/p>

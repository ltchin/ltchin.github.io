I was particularly proud of them at the time and save them here for memories&rsquo; sake.</p><h3 id=21l706---studies-in-film-color-in-film---spring-2017>21L.706 - Studies in Film: Color in Film - Spring 2017</h3><p>I took this class with <a href=https://lit.mit.edu/people/ebrinkema/>Professor Eugenie Brinkema</a>, the professor who inspired me to minor in Comparative Media Studies through her stunning teaching of 21L.011 - The Film Experience. For my last undergraduate semester at MIT, I took her seminar about color in film which pushed my analytical skills more than ever before.</p><ul><li><a href=/files/ltchin_21L706Midterm.pdf>Midterm paper</a> about how color exerts violence and trauma on the characters of <em>Upstream Color</em> and <em>Red Desert</em></li><li><a href=/files/ltchin_21L706Final.pdf>Final paper</a> about understanding the inherent contradictions within the monochrome by tracing its violence / redemption in <em>Blue</em>, <em>Tower</em>, and <em>Vertigo</em></li></ul><center><hr width=90%></center><h3 id=alice---2015-to-2017>Alice - 2015 to 2017</h3><p>After taking 21L.430 / CMS.920 (Narrative and Popular Culture: Children&rsquo;s Cultural Blockbusters) with <a href=http://lit.mit.edu/people/mgubar/>Professor Marah Gubar</a> in Spring 2015, I turned my passing interest in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> into a more scholarly one. I ended up teaching several classes about Alice and children&rsquo;s literature in general for <a href=https://esp.mit.edu/teach/teachers/ltchin/bio.html>MIT&rsquo;s Educational Studies Program</a>, modifying what I had learned from Professor Gubar into a class of my own.</p><ul><li><a href=/files/ltchin_21L430Final.pdf>21L.430 final paper</a> about how the 2010 Burton version of Alice turns her into a destroyer of narrative, civilization and childhood through its removal of nonsense (Spring 2015)</li><li><a href=/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015Prep.pdf>Preparation notes</a> and <a href=/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015InClass.pdf>in-class notes</a> from my Splash 2015 class.</li><li><a href=/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015Redux.pdf>Notes</a> from when I taught this class again for my friends in Winter 2016.</li><li><a href=/files/ltchin_ChildrensLit.pdf>Presentation</a> of a brief history of children&rsquo;s literature taught for Spring HSSP 2015 and Summer HSSP 2017</li><li><a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5g8szdZ4-yn6hgkOkmXURzXc35IcK8Bxj1boVlibAw/edit>Class notes</a> for my Summer HSSP 2017 version of my Alice class, a more in-depth, 6 week version of the one-off class I taught for Splash 2015</li></ul><center><hr width=90%></center><h3 id=cms616---games-and-culture---fall-2016>CMS.616 - Games and Culture - Fall 2016</h3><p>I took this class with <a href=http://tltaylor.com/>Professor TL Taylor</a>. It&rsquo;s honestly been an honor to work with her and I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed looking more in-depth in sociological issues around gaming. Although the papers were a bit more surface level than I would have liked, I definitely feel like I have the groundwork for doing more research</p><ul><li><a href=https://litchin.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/cms-616-multiplayer-tetris/>Midterm paper</a> studying the dynamics of different Tetris communities.</li><li><a href=/files/ltchin_CMS616Final.pdf>Final paper</a> about the co-creative relationship between speedrunners and developers.</li></ul><center><hr width=90%></center><h3 id=2671---measurement-and-instrumentation---spring-2016>2.671 - Measurement and Instrumentation - Spring 2016</h3><p>I took this class with Professors Mathias Kolle, Nic Fang and the inimitable <a href=https://hr.mit.edu/rewards/recipient/award-recipients/2011/serving-client/barbara-hughey>Barbara Hughey</a>. Although this was not my first choice of class to take, I find myself still referring back to its critical lessons of data presentation, lab notebook-keeping and measurement analysis.</p><p>The project I chose for this class was investigating how <a href=https://lolmy2671goforth.tumblr.com/post/144354047649/you-get-weird-cookies-if-you-dont-follow-the>varying ingredient ratios of a shortbread cookie recipe changed the end cookie result</a>. I chose this project because I wanted to build up my own intuition of how baking works rather than rotely following a recipe. While the cookies were questionable, I learned a lot about food science and even got to present this at the <a href=https://energy.mit.edu/news/mitei-energizes-visitors-at-the-mit-open-house/>MIT Open House</a>, thanks to Professor Fang.</p><ul><li><a href=/files/ltchin_2671Paper.pdf>Final paper</a> if you&rsquo;re curious about how terms like &ldquo;chewiness&rdquo; get quantified in a food science way.</li><li><a href=/files/ltchin_2671Poster.pdf>Poster</a> version of the above</li></ul><center><hr width=90%></center><h3 id=cms845---interactive-narrative---spring-2016>CMS.845 - Interactive Narrative - Spring 2016</h3><p>I took this class with <a href=http://www.nickm.com/classes/interactive_narrative/2016_spring/>Professor Nick Montfort</a>.

The main thing that I learned is that puzzle design is <em>hard.</em> While completable in its current state, it&rsquo;s extremely opaque at what the right moves should be, so don&rsquo;t beat yourself up over it too much for not finishing it.</p><ul><li><a href=/files/Inform/Daydream/index.html>Link</a> to play &ldquo;Daydream&rdquo; and see the story file.</li><li><a href=/files/Inform/mitchlee/index.html>&ldquo;Mitchell&rsquo;s Story&rdquo;</a> - An early prototype for me to learn how Inform worked.

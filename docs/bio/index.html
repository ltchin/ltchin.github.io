She is interested in designing robotic bodies and their materials for optimized interaction with their environment through embedded perception and computational design. Lillian received her bachelors, masters and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. For the 2023-2024 school year, she is currently working as a <a href=https://schmidtsciencefellows.org>Schmidt Science Fellow</a> at the National Institutes of Health under <a href=https://irp.nih.gov/pi/leonardo-cohen>Leo Cohen</a> and <a href=https://www.cc.nih.gov/meet-our-doctors/tbulea.html>Tom Bulea</a>.</p><p>She is the recipient of several fellowships including the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, the Hertz Foundation Graduate Fellowship and the Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans. Her work has been published in <em>Science</em> and <em>Science Advances</em> and has been recognized with awards such as the 2019 IEEE Robosoft Best Poster Award, the 2019 ACM CS and Law Best Paper Award and the 2022 Leventhal City Prize. Lillian has also focused heavily in research mentorship, mentoring 21 undergraduates and 2 masters students over her PhD to write 8 papers. Nearly two thirds of these students were women and other gender minorities, nearly half were underrepresented racial minorities, and a third were co-authors on papers.</p><nav class=footer><hr><p class=text-muted style=float:left;text-align:left><small>Last updated: Oct 12, 2023<br><a href=/about title="About this site">About this site</a></small></p><p style=float:right;text-align:right><small><a href=/bio>About Me</a><br><a href=https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/>Contact Me</a></small></p></nav></body></html>

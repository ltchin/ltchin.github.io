I can usually tell the writing style is hella annoying purple prose (link) it robs you of a chance to develop your own writing skills If you must use it, please ask for it to give you a very concise email and don&amp;rsquo;t just paste in the four paragraphs it spat out to you. I&amp;rsquo;d always prefer to see a email with many grammar mistakes than a generated email.</description></item><item><title>Crafting</title><link>/projects/crafting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/crafting/</guid><description>Cross-Stitching I started cross-stitch in Dec. 2019, because of this Shitpost Sampler goose pattern sent to me by a friend. I was so taken by it that I taught myself from online resources in order to learn how to make it. This started a near addiction in me, especially as I found myself with a lot of time and screen burnout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Since most of my traditional hobbies became off limits, cross-stitching quickly became my go-to.</description></item><item><title>Making</title><link>/projects/making/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/making/</guid><description>This page is under construction.

I might just have them as an image gallery setup or a CV of failures.

Bodies and the Built Environment In sci-fi, we imagine robots to be close companions to humans, living and working alongside us. However, real robots are quite far from this goal, including high-profile accidents such as a surveillance robot running over a toddler in 2016 or a chess-playing robot breaking a child&amp;rsquo;s finger in 2022. I argue that this is because current robot bodies are not well-suited for the environments that we place them in.</description></item><item><title>Who Taught Me</title><link>/research/who-taught-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/research/who-taught-me/</guid><description>Inspired by Aimi Hamraie&amp;rsquo;s list of who taught them, I&amp;rsquo;d like to make a (non-exhaustive) list of the people and things who taught me how to be a person and a researcher. Doing this is my way of fighting the great man theory approach that still tends to dominate academic framings. Academia provides precious little avenues to acknowledge and validate all of the people, labor and resources that shaped us, so here&amp;rsquo;s a page to celebrate the &amp;ldquo;interdependent researcher&amp;rdquo;!</description></item><item><title>Writing</title><link>/projects/writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/writing/</guid><description>Professional Pieces One of several stories solicited by The Nation &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Campuses Across the Country Are Closingâ€”These Are the Students Impacted&amp;rdquo;, March 16, 2020 Pitched and published a piece for The Bitter Southerner.

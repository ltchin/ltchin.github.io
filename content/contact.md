title: Contact Me
toc: true
preamble: Professors get a lot of emails (on the order of hundreds a day). That doesn't mean you shouldn't email them, but rather that you need to be strategic about how you email them to get a response. Here are my tips on how to get a response *from me*. These tips are probably useful for other professors as well, but you should ask them first!

> ## Note on ChatGPT
> I discourage using ChatGPT to email me because 
> 1. I can usually tell
> 2. the writing style is hella annoying purple prose (link)
> 3. it robs you of a chance to develop your own writing skills
> 
> If you must use it, please ask for it to give you a *very concise* email and don't just paste in the four paragraphs it spat out to you. I'd *always* prefer to see a email with many grammar mistakes than a generated email.

## Cold Email - General Tips
* Using my [contact form](https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/) will reduce the chance that your email gets into spam.
* Have your first paragraph be as short and sweet as possible. Bold is your friend if you want to highlight something for me to notice (so don't use it for every sentence!)

### Prospective Student
* Email very explicitly saying which project or research ideas on [the MERGe Lab website](https://merge-lab.github.io/research/) is a good fit
	* It's ok if it's not a well-formed idea, but if I don't see any attempt to explain how you are related to my existing project, you are unlikely to get a response back
	* **A bad advisor-advisee fit is worse than not getting into grad school at all.** We will both not be happy if you are doing something that you do not like for poor pay over 5-6 years.

* Think of talking with an academic like making music in a jam session (link). We need to have some common ground before we can start jamming.
	* Bad: "I'm interested in exoplanets" -- I don't do research on exoplanets
	* Bad: "My past research in exoplanets makes me a good fit for your lab's interest in tactile sensors" -- I still don't know what exoplanets have to do with tactile sensors.
	* Better: "I'm interested in using your devices to help make more accurate tools to discover exoplanets" -- Neat! I still don't know anything about exoplanets, but now there's something we can talk about. I'm super curious to know what connections you see between my work and your interest in exoplanets
	* Better: "I really liked your paper on X. I'd like to explore more topics on X, especially to apply them to exoplanets." -- Awesome! We can have a fun research conversation where I teach you about X and you can teach me about exoplanets!


## Communication Boundaries
If you know me personally, e-mail is the slowest way to get in contact with me. Please call, text or DM me on social media instead.

If you are not my student, colleague or do not know what my pet's species / name is, then you do not know me personally. Please do not use non-email channels to contact me until we have been introduced. Due to my [experiences with harassment](https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11674), I will *block you without hesitation* for violating these boundaries.

## Cold Email - Academic
* Using my [contact form](https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/) will reduce the chance that your email gets into spam.

### Prospective Student

## Cold Email - Personal


## Communication Boundaries
* If you know me personally, e-mail is the slowest way to get in contact with me. Please call, text or DM me on social media instead.
	* If you do not know what my pet's species / name is or what my favorite food is, then you do not know me personally. Please do not use non-email channels to contact me until we have been introduced.
	* Due to my [experiences with harassment](https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11674), I will *block you without hesitation* for violating these boundaries.

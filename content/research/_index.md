Since this is my personal website, it focuses on my *research roots*. I discuss the [research philosophy](/research/philosophy) that animates me and [highlight the people](/research/inspiration) who taught me how to think those thoughts.

If you'd like to know more about my specific research, please look at [my lab website](https://merge-lab.github.io/publications/), which will give the much more granular leaf-focused view of my research tree.


## The Research Tree Metaphor

The way I think about research is through the metaphor of the *research tree*. This was introduced to me by my PhD advisor, [Daniela Rus](https://danielarus.csail.mit.edu). Though she thinks of the research tree as a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)), I like thinking of it as an actual tree.

This metaphor works from the bottom up:
1. **Roots:** These are the true guiding principles that motivate you to do research. They stay underground most of the time
2. **Trunk:** The "thesis of the thesis". The core idea that defines your research.
3. **Branches:** Different questions that this core idea brings up
4. **Leaves:** Individual research papers that answer the branch's question

The way I think about research is through the metaphor of the *research tree*. This was introduced to me by my PhD advisor, [Daniela Rus](https://danielarus.csail.mit.edu). Though she thinks of the research tree as a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)), I like thinking of it as an actual tree.

This metaphor works from the bottom up:
1. **Roots:** These are the true guiding principles that motivate you to do research. They stay underground most of the time
2. **Trunk:** The "thesis of the thesis". The core idea that defines your research.
3. **Branches:** Different questions that this core idea brings up
4. **Leaves:** Individual research papers that answer the branch's question

Given this metaphor, this website focuses on my *research roots*, especially since this is my personal website. If you'd like to know more about my specific research, please look at [my lab website](https://merge-lab.github.io/publications/), which will give the much more granular leaf-focused view of my research tree.

title: Who Taught Me
---

Inspired by [Aimi Hamraie's](https://aimihamraie.com/Who-taught-me) list of who taught them, I'd like to make a (non-exhaustive) list of the people and things who taught me how to be a person and a researcher. Doing this is my way of fighting the [great man theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory) approach that still tends to dominate academic framings. Academia provides precious little avenues to acknowledge and validate all of the people, labor and resources that shaped us, so here's a page to celebrate the "interdependent researcher"!

> This page is under construction. I need to more fully collate my notes but for now, have some bullet points.


* Thinking and writing critically
	* Ryan Sample - for giving me my first push in what writing the power of writing could be
	* Brinkema - for opening my eyes to the beauty of the humanities. "When I'm lost, theory helps"
	* Crystal Lee and Jonathan Zong - for providing community in the challenging times
* Thinking critically about the built environment
	* TL Taylor - for exposing me to critical thinking about the social aspects of infrastructure
	* Sara Hendren - for that simple provocation of "how does the body meet the world"
* Tracing power
	* Dad - for raising me to question
	* sadun - for org charts and yearbooks
* Beauty of mentorship
	* Chris Harrow - for the enthusiasm for how beautiful math can be
	* Michael Leamy - for taking a chance and always believing in me
	* Greg Xie - for trusting me from start to finish of the development of a researcher
	* The Terrascope DnD crew (Max, Rin, Daniel, Grey) - for the wide experiences and making me feel "adopted"


* "Ableism is at the root of your oppression"
	* "You deserve love just for being human" - Alex, Darby, Noor, Kris
	* I fought hard to be soft -- that cohost post

* Empathy is hard yet beautiful since you will never be able to understand the experience of another
	* Jonah, SQuAT, Spike Lee's *Do The Right Thing* -- for providing the nudge when I was wrong
	* Reading road signs on a road trip of the US, giving a distributed yet immense sense of the loss that Indigenous people experienced

* Narratives matter. The stories of the stories
	* Daniela Rus -- the power of framing
	* *American Gods* - Neil Gaiman
	* Mehitabel Glenhaber -- why history matters

* Maintaining interdisciplinary hope
	* Julie Shah - "I know all the ways that systems can fail. And yet we still build"
	* David Mindell - in a time when it seemed like age must lead to cynicism, giving a different perspective

* There's always a spot for the weirdos
	* Nate Mattias - insisting on avoiding the funding
	* Ryaan Ahmed - for expanding my world beyond my limited boxes
	* Kate Darling - for facing things with strength and poise
	* Angela Chen - for making my soul sing with being understood

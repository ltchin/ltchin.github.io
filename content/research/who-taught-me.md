title: Who Taught Me
---

Inspired by [Aimi Hamraie's](https://aimihamraie.com/Who-taught-me) list of who taught them, I'd like to make a (non-exhaustive) list of the people and things who taught me how to be a person and a researcher. Doing this is my way of fighting the [great man theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory) approach that still tends to dominate academic framings. Academia provides precious little avenues to acknowledge and validate all of the people, labor and resources that shaped us, so here's a page to celebrate the "interdependent researcher"!

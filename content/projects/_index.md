title: Projects

In some sense, all of these side projects are trying to accomplish the same thing: bring something into the world that didn't exist before. The only difference is the style with which they are worked on.
* Crafting - descends from the idea of ["handicraft" / "arts and crafts"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicraft). The focus is less on tool building and more about the direct expression of the creator's artistic intent
* Making - descends from the ["makerspace" / DIY culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture). The focus is on building devices in line with engineering / shop culture.
* Writing - there is after all, [nothing outside the text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida#Philosophy). 

I've become more secure in my identity as an engineer and no longer feel any shame to say that my proudest projects have been in writing and art. If you're going to take a look at any, please look at those!

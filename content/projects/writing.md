title: Writing
preamble: Beyond the technical writing I do for my [research papers](/research/index.html), I do a lot of personal writing on the side, sometimes for pay, but most often for not. Most of this writing is either from undergraduate classes or from my student activism work.

### litchin@ - 2014 to present

I keep an active blog at [litchin.wordpress.com](http://litchin.wordpress.com). This site started as an archive of the posts made from my literary mailing list (litchin@) and my musical mailing list (mellifluously@). While the lively community of responses are missing from the archive, the musings have not stopped.

### Student Activism - 2014 to 2020

Below are pieces that I personally wrote about student government actions or student activism efforts I was involved in. Please see [the activism section of my Press page](/press/index.html#activism) for more context.

*   [Essay](/files/ltchin_Burchard.pdf) I wrote as part of my application for the [Burchard Scholars program](http://shass.mit.edu/undergraduate/scholarships/burchard), a quick summary of my 2014-2015 protests against changes in the MIT Dormitory Security Policy
*   [Op-ed](https://thetech.com/2016/04/19/security-policies) I wrote for The Tech (MIT's student-run newspaper) encouraging students to get involved in student goverment. Heavily related to my work in trying to improve student-admin collaborations through the Undergraduate Association.
*   [Op-ed](https://thetech.com/2019/02/28/history-new-vassar-design) I wrote for The Tech about being involved in initial conversations about the New Vassar dorm and seeing how this student government work was actively overturned by the MIT Division for Student Life
*   [Blogpost](https://litchin.wordpress.com/2019/10/01/an-oral-history/) summarizing what it felt like to be at MIT in Fall 2019, where I was entirely too close to the unfolding MIT-Epstein scandal.
*   [Stream](https://youtu.be/jJDFoKhOgJs) of me going through the [MIT-Epstein Goodwin Procter report](http://factfindingjan2020.mit.edu/) page by page
*   [Informal presentation](https://youtu.be/zqsGduaE-50) of me info-dumping everything I knew about how MIT works, as of March 2020. Transcript can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlkIJybavh9F3aZEffRIjpRHbwN5t2c99hq84xOHEgM/edit?usp=sharing) and slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dwwfnt_zVj-taaW9EX1uG-9qK8kTc7tDI6QKEpghXto/edit#slide=id.p).
*  [Reflective summary](/files/ltchin_MITEpstein2023.pdf) written in 2023 of the MIT-Epstein scandal that I wrote as part of my interview prep for the Schmidt Science Fellows

## Undergraduate Writing

Below are some papers from classes that I took at MIT as an undergrad. I was particularly proud of them at the time and save them here for memories' sake.

### 21L.706 - Studies in Film: Color in Film - Spring 2017

I took this class with [Professor Eugenie Brinkema](https://lit.mit.edu/people/ebrinkema/), the professor who inspired me to minor in Comparative Media Studies through her stunning teaching of 21L.011 - The Film Experience. For my last undergraduate semester at MIT, I took her seminar about color in film which pushed my analytical skills more than ever before.

*   [Midterm paper](/files/ltchin_21L706Midterm.pdf) about how color exerts violence and trauma on the characters of _Upstream Color_ and _Red Desert_
*   [Final paper](/files/ltchin_21L706Final.pdf) about understanding the inherent contradictions within the monochrome by tracing its violence / redemption in _Blue_, _Tower_, and _Vertigo_

### Alice - 2015 to 2017

After taking 21L.430 / CMS.920 (Narrative and Popular Culture: Children's Cultural Blockbusters) with [Professor Marah Gubar](http://lit.mit.edu/people/mgubar/) in Spring 2015, I turned my passing interest in _Alice in Wonderland_ into a more scholarly one. I ended up teaching several classes about Alice and children's literature in general for [MIT's Educational Studies Program](https://esp.mit.edu/teach/teachers/ltchin/bio.html), modifying what I had learned from Professor Gubar into a class of my own.

*   [21L.430 final paper](/files/ltchin_21L430Final.pdf) about how the 2010 Burton version of Alice turns her into a destroyer of narrative, civilization and childhood through its removal of nonsense (Spring 2015)
*   [Preparation notes](/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015Prep.pdf) and [in-class notes](/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015InClass.pdf) from my Splash 2015 class.
*   [Notes](/files/ltchin_AliceSplash2015Redux.pdf) from when I taught this class again for my friends in Winter 2016.
*   [Presentation](/files/ltchin_ChildrensLit.pdf) of a brief history of children's literature taught for Spring HSSP 2015 and Summer HSSP 2017
*   [Class notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5g8szdZ4-yn6hgkOkmXURzXc35IcK8Bxj1boVlibAw/edit) for my Summer HSSP 2017 version of my Alice class, a more in-depth, 6 week version of the one-off class I taught for Splash 2015

### CMS.616 - Games and Culture - Fall 2016

I took this class with [Professor TL Taylor](http://tltaylor.com/). It's honestly been an honor to work with her and I've really enjoyed looking more in-depth in sociological issues around gaming. Although the papers were a bit more surface level than I would have liked, I definitely feel like I have the groundwork for doing more research

*   [Midterm paper](https://litchin.wordpress.com/2016/10/18/cms-616-multiplayer-tetris/) studying the dynamics of different Tetris communities.
*   [Final paper](/files/ltchin_CMS616Final.pdf) about the co-creative relationship between speedrunners and developers.

### 2.671 - Measurement and Instrumentation - Spring 2016

I took this class with Professors Mathias Kolle, Nic Fang and the inimitable [Barbara Hughey](https://hr.mit.edu/rewards/recipient/award-recipients/2011/serving-client/barbara-hughey). Although this was not my first choice of class to take, I find myself still referring back to its critical lessons of data presentation, lab notebook-keeping and measurement analysis.

The project I chose for this class was investigating how [varying ingredient ratios of a shortbread cookie recipe changed the end cookie result](https://lolmy2671goforth.tumblr.com/post/144354047649/you-get-weird-cookies-if-you-dont-follow-the). I chose this project because I wanted to build up my own intuition of how baking works rather than rotely following a recipe. While the cookies were questionable, I learned a lot about food science and even got to present this at the [MIT Open House](https://energy.mit.edu/news/mitei-energizes-visitors-at-the-mit-open-house/), thanks to Professor Fang.

*   [Final paper](/files/ltchin_2671Paper.pdf) if you're curious about how terms like "chewiness" get quantified in a food science way.
*   [Poster](/files/ltchin_2671Poster.pdf) version of the above

### CMS.845 - Interactive Narrative - Spring 2016

I took this class with [Professor Nick Montfort](http://www.nickm.com/classes/interactive_narrative/2016_spring/). It's been the first time in a while since I've done a creative writing class since elementary school and I found the work really cool.

#### _Ex Machina_ by Jonathan Ball

*   [Twine version](/projects/ExMachina.html) of the main book
*   [Graph of connections](/img_static/ExMachinaGraph.jpg), made by Joshua Sloane using Mathematica
*   [Analysis](/files/ltchin_ExMachina.pdf) of the book

#### Daydream

For my final digital project, I made a text adventure to make fun at the central topic of the class: "[metalepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalepsis#Narratology)". The main thing that I learned is that puzzle design is _hard._ While completable in its current state, it's extremely opaque at what the right moves should be, so don't beat yourself up over it too much for not finishing it.

*   [Link](/files/Inform/Daydream/index.html) to play "Daydream" and see the story file.
*   ["Mitchell's Story"](/files/Inform/mitchlee/index.html) - An early prototype for me to learn how Inform worked. Related to "Daydream", I promise!

### CMS.300 - Introduction to Video Game Theory - Fall 2015

I took this class with [Professor Mikael Jakobsson](http://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/mikael-jakobsson/). I really enjoyed this class and managed to write papers that I didn't feel were overly rushed by my college life. I also really appreciated the opportunity to dig deeply into game studies, which was something I never had a formal grounding in before taking this class.

*   [Analysis](/files/ltchin_EpicSaxGame.pdf) of [_Epic Sax Game_](http://www.pippinbarr.com/games/epicsaxgame/EpicSaxGame.html)
*   [Analysis](/files/ltchin_PapersPlease.pdf) of [_Papers, Please_](https://papersplea.se/)
*   [Analysis](/files/ltchin_Pikmin2.pdf) of [_Pikmin 2_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin_2). Also [research notes](/files/ltchin_Pikmin2_Notes.pdf)

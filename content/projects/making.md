preamble: The line between "crafting" and "making" is really fuzzy (and highly gendered). I tried to split the line as "craft" being the pursuit of aesthetics, while "make" being the pursuit of functionality. In other words, the items in this section were created more to achieve a functional goal or task. <p></p> Most of these stem from class projects, as I've found less enjoyment of making things when my job is also engineering. Perhaps as I shift to a more managerial role, my tinkering tendencies will spring up again!

> This page is under construction. For now, enjoy my notes from the previous iteration of the website for what to include. All of these are from undergrad, so I may not include any of these moving forwards. I might just have them as an image gallery setup or a CV of failures.

**Proud (in undergrad) Projects**
* This website!
	* [Lovingly hand-coded](https://github.com/ltchin/ltchin.github.io) since 2016
* 2.75 Delivery forceps. 
	* Taken in Fall 2016
	* Forceps with rotational and sensing capabilities for operative vaginal delivery
* 2.72 Desktop Lathe
	* Taken in Spring 2016, won class competition
	* Desktop lathe with 50 micron precision, even after being dropped

**Other Projects**
* Daydream
	* Fall 2016
	* IF game written for Montfort's class
* Guided Dream
	* Fall 2016
	* Writing version of Gregory Weir's 'Silent Conversation'
* 6.131 - Audio equalization board
	* Fall 2015
	* As the final project of 6.131, Power Electronics Lab, I made a simple audio equalizer board. The board would filter out bass, treble and mid level frequencies, amplify them according to user input and output the sound.
* 6.115 - Virtual Reality Game
	* Spring 2015
	* As the final project of 6.115, Micrcocontroller Project Lab, I created a simple virtual reality game. The player would control their character through a maze on an LCD screen by shining a flashlight on to different light sensors while stepping on a pressure pad to control their movements.
* Derpskates
	* Jan 2015
	* Attempt to make skates that could be worn with normal shoes on, allowing you to easily slip them on and off. Mostly a lesson in planning.
* Battlecode

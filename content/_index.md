## About Me
Hello! I'm Lilly Chin, an assistant professor at UT Austin's Electrical and Computer Engineering department, where I run [MERGe Lab](https://merge-lab.github.io/). 

<!-- * Before emailing me, read [**THIS**](/contact) for the highest chance of a reply. -->

* For my current research, refer to the MERGe Lab [research](https://merge-lab.github.io/research/) and [publication](https://merge-lab.github.io/publications) pages.

<!-- > **I am actively looking for graduate students and postdocs for the 2024-2025 school year.** If interested, please apply directly to [UT Austin ECE](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/academics/graduate/admissions), listing my name, and [contact me](https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/) explaining what research interests we share. -->

{{< small_hr >}}

This is my personal website and thus focuses on me rather than my job. The academic pages here highlight my [philosophy towards research](/research/philosophy) and the [people who shaped that philosophy](/research/who-taught-me)

This website also serves as an archive of my personal projects, ranging from [engineering](/projects/making) to [visual art](/projects/crafting) to [amateur and professional writing](/projects/writing). I also keep an archive of my higher visibility activities such as my performance on Jeopardy! as the [2017 College Champion / "spiciest memelord"](/press/#jeopardy).

## Jeopardy

I won the [2017 Jeopardy College Championship](https://www.jeopardy.com/tournaments/2017/college-championship), which led me to getting a lot of media attention, especially for my memetic Final Jeopardy response. I was then invited to compete on the [2017 Jeopardy Tournament of Champions](https://www.jeopardy.com/tournaments/2017/tournament-of-champions), where I got to the semifinals.

My stats on Jeopardy can be found on [J-Archive](http://www.j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=11142). My old (not very impressive) NAQT trivia stats can be found [here.](https://www.naqt.com/stats/player/index.jsp?contact_id=92383)

Since Jeopardy is a national show, below is only a selection of the articles written about me, chosen either for notability, for actually interviewing me or for providing a different perspective.

* [Podcast interview for _Digital Void_](https://www.digitalvoid.media/podcast/ep-42-lilly-chin), focusing largely on my [First Monday paper](https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/11674/10115) about my Jeopardy experiences
* [Podcast interview for _Institrve_](https://institrve.com/004-nontrivial-consequences/), a podcast focusing on stories from MIT
* [WBUR interview](https://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2020/11/10/jeopardy-contestant-alex-trebek) reflecting on Alex Trebek's passing
* [Podcast interview for _Otherhood_](https://www.pri.org/programs/otherhood/spiciest-memelord-revealed) with BBC Reporter Rupa Shenoy from Public Radio International. Contextualizes being on Jeopardy in the context of my identity as an Asian-American. Shortened version that premiered on The World is [here](https://www.pri.org/programs/pris-world/helping-victims-sex-trafficking-woman-fights-gold-mine-and-pushing-k-pop)
* [Jeopardy Official Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6KXUvgpeHM) with 2018 Jeopardy College Championship semifinalists
* [The Ringer hype article](https://www.theringer.com/tv/2017/11/13/16644420/jeopardy-tournament-of-champions), mainly linked because I am a "merciless trivia assassin slash love of \[their\] life"
* [MIT Admissions blog interview](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/lilly-chin) with my friend, Vincent
* [MIT Admissions blog hype post](http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/emergency-blog-post-because-lilly-chin-is-the-greatest-of-all-time) from Petey

## Activism

Throughout my time at MIT as an undergraduate and graduate student, I have felt called upon to speak truth to power. Below is a compilation of articles that either use my picture or quote me directly. In this space, I've tried to focus on what other people have written about the situation. My own write-ups on what happened are either repeated here or can be found in my [Writing](/projects/writing/index.html) page.

### MIT COVID Response (2020)

In March 2020, as it became increasingly clear that COVID-19 was present in the United States, MIT and many other schools decided to evict all of its students. While this was a wise public health decision, the execution was slapdash and needlessly cruel to international students and students with unsafe home lives. These students were denied promised exemptions, forcing mass student action to overturn these initial decisions.

* The Daily Beast -- [‘Warzone’: MIT Students Enraged by Coronavirus Banishment](https://www.thedailybeast.com/warzone-mit-students-enraged-by-coronavirus-banishment)
* WBUR -- ["As College Students Leave Dorms During Coronavirus, Mix Of Fear And Resignation"](https://www.wbur.org/edify/2020/03/13/coronavirus-dorms-empty)
* The Nation -- ["Campuses Across the Country Are Closing—These Are the Students Impacted"](https://www.thenation.com/article/society/campuses-across-the-country-are-closing-these-are-the-students-impacted/), own words

### MIT-Epstein Crisis (2019-2020)

Over Fall 2019, it became clear that MIT had taken money from Jeffrey Epstein and undertaken steps to anonymize / hide that donations were made. In the process of protesting this, I accidentally started a flame war on a department mailing list which led to Richard Stallman making misogynistic comments. This was the last straw for a decades-long pattern, eventually leading to his resignation.

A contemporary chronological summary of events from my perspective can be read [here](https://litchin.wordpress.com/2019/10/01/an-oral-history/). A 2023 summary and reflection of the events that I wrote as part of my interview prep for the Schmidt Science Fellows can be read [here](/files/ltchin_MITEpstein2023.pdf).

* The Tech -- [#They Knew protesters rally against MIT's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein](https://thetech.com/2019/09/19/they-knew-protest-against-epstein-donations)
* VICE News -- ["Famed Computer Scientist Richard Stallman Described Epstein Victims As 'Entirely Willing'"](https://www.vice.com/en/article/9ke3ke/famed-computer-scientist-richard-stallman-described-epstein-victims-as-entirely-willing)
* The Tech -- ["Student forum about MIT-Epstein relations held with Reif, senior admin present"](https://thetech.com/2019/10/03/mit-epstein-student-forum)
* The Tech -- [North Court renamed after Susan Hockfield](https://thetech.com/2019/10/10/protestors-rally-against-renaming-hockfield-court)

### MIT Undergraduate Student Life (2013-2017)

#### Dorm Security Protests (2014 - 2015)

In the 2014-2015 school year, "dorm security" became a subcontracted position, replacing student workers and creating an unwelcome environment, as summarized [here](https://thetech.com/2014/11/18/dormsecurity-v134-n55), [here](https://thetech.com/2015/04/17/letters-v135-n12), and [here](https://thetech.com/2016/04/08/security-v136-n11). My frustration with these rules led me to first conduct my own surveys and then later chair the Undergraduate Association's (UA's) Committee on Student-Administration Collaboration.

* [Personal essay](/files/ltchin_Burchard.pdf) summarizing my 2014-2015 protests against changes in the MIT Dormitory Security Policy
* The Tech -- ["Students: get involved with MIT's policymaking processes"](https://thetech.com/2016/04/19/security-policies), op-ed summarizing how dorm security led me to undergraduate student government

#### UA Student-Admin Collaboration Committee(2015 - 2017)

As the chair of the UA Committee on Student-Administration Collaboration, I was one of the key student government officials when student-admin relations fell through. This happened most dramatically with the forced closure of the Senior House dorm, as summarized contemporaneously [here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/whats-happening-with-senior-house/) and [here](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/data-justice-for-senior-house/).

title: About This Site
---
This site is a hybrid of [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com)'s website in Jekyll and [Yihui Xie](https://xmin.yihui.org/)'s XMin template for Hugo. I ported most of my old Bootstrap + Jekyll website to a Hugo version where I try to 
1. understand every line of code rather than copy-pasting wholesale
1. minimize Javascript usage
1. make the website accessible to screen readers
1. make the website accessible to low bandwidth users

Please [let me know](https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/) if you have some recommendations for how to better achieve those goals. I particularly welcome feedback from users with disabilities.

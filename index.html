	<p>I'm Lilly Chin. I'm currently a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, minoring in Mechanical Engineering (class of 2017)</p>
	
	<p>	Overall, I'm interested in the <u><i>interdisciplinary</i></u> - whether robotics, medical device design or comparative media studies. Wherever I can just tinker and learn how things work - that's where I thrive. </p>

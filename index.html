	<p>I'm Lilly Chin. I'm currently a PhD candidate at MIT in <a href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/">Daniela Rus' lab</a>. I graduated from MIT in 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with minors in Mechanical Engineering and Comparative Media Studies</p>

	<p>In engineering, I am primarily interested in <u><b>robotics hardware design</u></b>, especially creating new versatile electrical / mechanical systems. This has led me to research soft robotics and additive manufacturing.</p>
	
	<p>In the humanities, I am interested in studying how <u><b>duration and violence are mediated through formal / aesthetic elements</u></b> to become (un)bearable across media. I am particularly interested in video games, film, and Internet culture. I have a secondary interest in understanding narrative, especially within interactive media and metanarratives</p>

	<p>	Overall, I'm interested in the <u><i>interdisciplinary</i></u> - whether robotics, medical device design or media studies. Wherever I can just tinker and learn how things work - that's where I thrive. </p>

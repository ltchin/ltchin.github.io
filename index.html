	<p>Lilly Chin is a graduate student at MIT in <a href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/">Daniela Rus' lab</a>, working towards a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. She graduated from MIT in 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with minors in Mechanical Engineering and Comparative Media Studies. Her technical research interests are in <b>robotics hardware design</b>, especially creating new versatile electrical / mechanical systems in <b>soft robotics</b>, with a focus on soft actuators and tactile sensors.</p>

	<p>Lilly is perhaps better known as the 2017 Jeopardy College Champion / "spiciest memelord". This reflects her humanities research interests - studying how <b>duration and violence are mediated through formal / aesthetic elements</b> to become (un) bearable across media and how this is reflected when <b>old and new forms of media collide</b>. She studies this behavior through video games, film and internet culture as well as through interactive narratives and stories about stories. </p>

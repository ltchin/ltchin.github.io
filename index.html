	<p><b>Lillian (Lilly) Chin</b> is a graduate student at MIT in <a href="http://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/">Daniela Rus' lab</a>, working towards a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. She graduated from MIT in 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with minors in Mechanical Engineering and Comparative Media Studies. </p>

	<p>Her <a href="/research/index.html">technical research interests</a> are in creating <b>computational material robots</b> -- robots with advanced functionality through the algorithmic design of their material properties. Her research has focused on the systems-level design of <b>soft robotic manipulators</b> with new actuators and sensor integration.</p>

	<p>Lillian is perhaps better known as the <a href="projects/writing/index.html#Jeopardy_-_2017_to_present">2017 Jeopardy College Champion</a> / "spiciest memelord". This reflects her <a href="/projects/writing/index.html">humanities research interests</a> - studying how <b>old and new forms of media collide</b>, chiefly in video games, film and internet culture. Specifically, she is interested in the media literacy required to maintain an understanding of duration, identity, and narrative in a world of increasing automation, networking and hyper-mediation. </p>
